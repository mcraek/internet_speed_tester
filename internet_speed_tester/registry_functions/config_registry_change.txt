- Pass it a root key location
- If the root key location doesn't exist create it
- Also pass subkey and expected value
- If the subkey doesn't exist it's created
- If the subkey doens't have the expected value, it's changed
- Information returned:

Original value
Did the root key exist
Did the subkey exist
The original subkey value

- Subkey will linger, that's ok
- Above info is used to restore original setting if there
was an original setting

- Goal is to be able to create / set IE Zoom Factor value,
and IE Protected zone settings with a single function
and return this info back to restore original settings after
